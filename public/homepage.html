        When I was 13, I learned the essence of working by volunteering with my
        mother at Salvation Army. I learned that helping people, connecting with
        them became a passion of mine. Throughout high school, I worked a part
        time job as a line cook and I discovered my love for the culinary arts
        and decided to pursue that and elevate my skills in customer relations
        and culinary. I moved my way up from line cook to a chef position and I
        thought that's where I wanted to be. After years of being in the back of
        the house making food for people and their loved ones, I felt something
        was missing. I realized I lost that passion, that motivation that drove
        me to where I'm at today. I took a step back and asked myself what I
        wanted. I wanted to seek more, I wanted to learn more. I finally decided
        to pursue my dreams of becoming a coder and I'm grateful for that
        decision as I know that coding is something that is forever evolving;
        there would always be something new for me to learn and connecting with
        people came with the territory. I am humble for my background in the
        service and food industry. It taught me hard work, patience, and how to
        work with people who don't see things the same way that I do. It taught
        me leadership and how to take initiative and get my team to work
        smarter. It taught me that I can learn anything. That's what I'm
        grateful for the most. I am a Full Stack Web Developer in training and I
        look forward to using the new skills that I learned.
